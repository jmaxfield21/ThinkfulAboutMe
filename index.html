			<p class="section_details"> 
				I'm a Software Engineer at <a href="http://www.octanner.com" target="_blank">O.C. Tanner</a>.
				Most of my experience is in back end work using Java but I 
				really want to learn and improve in front end development. I
				recently graduated from college and would like to continue learning!
			</p>
			<p class="section_details">
				I <strong>LOVE</strong> soccer. I have played my whole life and it is actually
				what paid for part of my schooling! I am a supporter/fan of 
				<a href="http://www.realsaltlake.com/" target="_blank">Real Salt Lake</a> 
				and <a href="http://www.manutd.com" target="_blank">Manchester United</a>. Having played as much as I have, 
				it has become a really big outlet for me from the stress of everyday life.

			<h1 class="section_headings">Where I'm From</h1>
			<p class="section_details">

			<h1 class="section_headings">More About Me</h1>
			<h3 class="subsection_headings">Hobbies</h3>
			<p class="section_details">
				Mostly I love to play soccer, go camping, workout, and stay active.
				I also am rediscovering my love for reading. I also am a BIG foodie. I
				love food and trying new food.
			</p>
			<h3 class="subsection_headings">Dream Job</h3>
			<p class="section_details">
				Anything that will make me excited to go into work everyday.
				I love what I do but it is almost seems like it missing just that
				extra little thing. I have really been getting into web development lately. There 
				may be a future for me in that for me.
			</p>
			<h3 class="subsection_headings">Important To Me</h3>
			<p class="section_details">
				I love my family. They are everything to me. I love my wife.
			</p>
			<h3 class="subsection_headings">Music</h3>
			<p class="section_details">
				I have been listening to a lot of classic Rock-N-Roll lately. AC/DC, Motley Crue,
				Quiet Riot, Rolling Stones, Led Zepplin, Twisted Sister, Poison, Guns N' Roses, Foreigner,
				Scorpions, all of it. Love it.
